<p>Coding the Humanities is a collective of professors, researchers, students and private partners, who build a tool that helps teachers leverage the knowledge of students and existing (online) information and to facilitate a new way of learning.</p>

<p>Schools and universities don’t leverage students’ knowledge and existing (online) information. They waste resources, and degrees become increasingly expensive.</p>

<p>Imagine two classrooms. In the first classroom, you see a teacher surrounded by students. The teacher teaches, the students learn. The students’ knowledge is wasted. In the second classroom, you see people. People who are teaching and learning from each other. Knowledge is leveraged and shared. Traditional education is modelled after the first classroom. Resources are wasted, and degrees become more and more expensive.</p>

<p>Marijn Koolen and Jan Hein Hoogstad envisioned the second classroom: an alternative space to leverage the classroom’s resources by searching, sorting and sharing the knowledge of each person in the group. With a grant from the University of Amsterdam, they founded Coding the Humanities.</p>

  <div><h2 id="alternative-rules-impatience-laziness-and-hubris">Alternative Rules: Impatience, Laziness and Hubris</h2>

<p>Coding the Humanities is the title of a course that teaches humanities students to code their own tools for research. Learning programming follows alternative rules. Be impatient, not patient. Be lazy, not diligent. Be bold, not modest. Don’t wait until you know everything, but take what people have learned before you and make something new, Google everything and show off what you learn, as early and as often as you can.</p>

<p>Art, Science and Technology followed the same rules. The alternative classroom is no longer separated from the world outside it, but is fully integrated in it. It not only uses the knowledge that people bring into the classroom, but takes information that is already out there instead of making its own. As with coding, everything you may want to learn is already out there. Don’t waste time creating new resources, but use what’s already there.</p>
